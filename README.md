# Instructional-Video-Summarization
This is the official pytorch implementation of "TL;DW? Summarizing Instructional Videos with Task Relevance &amp; Cross-Modal Saliency" ECCV 2022.
In this repository we provide the datasets, code for pseudo ground-truth summary generation, training, and testing as described in the paper.

## Environment Setup

Create the conda environment from the yaml file and activate the environment,

```
conda env create -f vsum.yml
conda activate vsum
```

## Dataset

### WikiHow Summaries

First, extract the files in datasets/how_to_steps.tar.gz

```
tar -xzvf datasets/how_to_steps.tar.gz
```

Next, download the WikiHow Summaries dataset to the datasets folder by running

```
cd Instructional-Video-Summarization
python wikihow_video_download.py
```

### Pseudo Summaries Training Dataset

We use videos from [COIN](https://coin-dataset.github.io/) and [CrossTask](https://github.com/DmZhukov/CrossTask) to create the Pseudo Summaries Training Dataset. Please follow the instructions on the original websites to download the videos, the corresponding subtitles and the task annotations. For COIN, we use yt-dlp to download subtitles. We combined the two datasets to create pseudo summaries comprising of 12,160 videos, whilst using the videos that were common to both datasets only once. We provide YouTube video IDs of the 12160 videos in . 

Place the videos and ASR in . 

## Pseudo Ground-Truth Summary Generation

We provide the pseudo ground-truth summary annotations are found in . These were generated by running the pseudo summary generation algorithm,
